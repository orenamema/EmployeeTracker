# EmployeeTracker - MySQL

## Introduction

I've created a schema database containing three tables:
* Department
* Role
* Employee

I've also created a command line to do the following:

* Add departments, roles, employees
* View departments, roles, employees
* Update employee roles

This application is ideal for a manager that wants to view and manage the different departments, roles and employees in the company. This will allow the manager to plan its work and projects.

## Technology Used
* [MySQL](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mysql)
* [InquirerJs](https://www.npmjs.com/package/inquirer/v/0.2.3)
