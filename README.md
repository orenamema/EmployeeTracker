# EmployeeTracker - MySQL

## Introduction

In this project I've created a Content Management System that allows the user to track employees easily.This application is ideal for a manager that wants to view and manage the different departments, roles and employees in the company. This will allow the manager to plan its work and projects.

I've created a schema database containing three tables:
* Department
* Role
* Employee

## Technology Used
* [MySQL](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mysql)
* [InquirerJs](https://www.npmjs.com/package/inquirer/v/0.2.3)
* [console.table](https://www.npmjs.com/package/console.table)
## Application

## Requirements

Following are the minimum requirements that the command line application does:
  * Add departments, roles, employees
  * View departments, roles, employees
  * Update employee roles
